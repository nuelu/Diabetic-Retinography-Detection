# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Detecting diabetic retinopathy disease from the two-dimensional color fundus images using ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 Models
I built two models to detect diabetic retinopathy disease, utilized two over-sampling techniques; class weights and SMOTE.
I used class weights with RESNET50 and I utilized SMOTE with EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB0 performed better.
The evaluation metric are: Overall AUC, AUC's in Female and Male groups respectively.
Dataset- ODIR-5K

Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This study aims to automate the detection process through machine learning models, reducing the dependency on manual screening.
