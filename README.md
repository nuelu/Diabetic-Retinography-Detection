# Diabetic-Retinography-Detection
Detecting diabetic retinography disease from the two-dimensional color fundus images using ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 Models
I built two models to detect diabetic retinograpghy disease, utilized two over-sampling techniques; class weights and SMOTE.
I used class weights with RESNET50 and I utilized SMOTE with EfficientNetB0. EfficientNetB0 performed better.
The evaluation metric are: Overall AUC, AUC's in Female and Male groups respectively.
Dataset- ODIR-5K
